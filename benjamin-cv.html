		<h1>&#128153; Benjamin's CV &#128153;</h1>

        <h2>Profile Summary (General):</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing my GCSEs and A Levels, I took a gap year to take a break from education. 
            I gained lots of valuable work experience with remote working in customer service, market research and telephone interviewing, but also factory work and administration in person. 
            Furthermore, I also volunteered briefly during summer, and took part in online courses to further develop my skillset. 
            My previous studies have given me a strong foundation in computing and written communication skills, while my work experience has enabled me to develop soft skills such as strong customer service, resilience and teamwork.
            Currently, I'm studying at university and hoping to make more connections in the computing industry.
        </p>

	<p>
	    I am currently studying for a Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity degree. 
	    I have had previous work experience in my gap year working both remotely and in person, developing my written communication and time management skills the most. 
	    My unique selling point is that I have also done an internship for HearMe, a mental health company, helping me become more empathetic and develop my active listening skills.  
	    I have applied with this company as I want to start my professional career with a company that is innovative, environmentally friendly and forward thinking.
