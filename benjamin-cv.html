		<h1>Benjamin's CV</h1>

        <h2>Profile Summary:</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing my GCSEs and A Levels, I took a gap year to take a break from education. 
            I gained lots of valuable work experience with remote working in customer service, market research and telephone interviewing, but also factory work and administration in person. 
            Furthermore, I also volunteered briefly during summer, and took part in online courses to further develop my skillset. 
            My previous studies have given me a strong foundation in computing and written communication skills, while my work experience has enabled me to develop soft skills such as strong customer service, resilience and teamwork.
            Currently, I'm studying at university and hoping to make more connections in the computing industry.
