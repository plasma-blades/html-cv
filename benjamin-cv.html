		<h1>&#128153; Benjamin's CV &#128153;</h1>

        <h2>Profile Summary (General):</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing my GCSEs and A Levels, I took a gap year to take a break from education. 
            I gained lots of valuable work experience with remote working in customer service, market research and telephone interviewing, but also factory work and administration in person. 
            Furthermore, I also volunteered briefly during summer, and took part in online courses to further develop my skillset. 
            My previous studies have given me a strong foundation in computing and written communication skills, while my work experience has enabled me to develop soft skills such as strong customer service, resilience and teamwork.
            Currently, I'm studying at university and hoping to make more connections in the computing industry.
        </p>

	<h2>Profile Summary (Targeted):</h2>
	<p>
	    I am currently studying for a Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity degree. 
	    I have had previous work experience in my gap year working both remotely and in person, developing my written communication and time management skills the most. 
	    My unique selling point is that I have also done an internship for HearMe, a mental health company, helping me become more empathetic and develop my active listening skills.  
	    I have applied with this company as I want to start my professional career with a company that is innovative, environmentally friendly and forward thinking. 
	</p>

        <h2>Skill Summary:</h2>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>
            Working as a Virtual Intern as well as a CX Intern has allowed me to communicate with both team members and customers. 
            This has helped develop my interpersonal communication skills. My academic experience has developed my written communication skills. 
            I am proficient at writing reports and preparing essays with strict guidelines.
        </p>

        <h3>IT and Tech Skills</h3>
        <p>
            Competent user of Microsoft Office and Google Suite. Some knowledge of C#, CSS and HTML5. 
        </p>

	<h3>Deadline Management</h3>
	<p>
	    Studying at university has allowed me to further develop my deadline management skils.
	    This is because I often had multiple assignments due in at similar times, forcing me to prioritise my tasks.
	</p>

	<h3>Reliabilty</h3>
	<p>
	    Throughout my gap year I have had to be reliable by setting realistic timeframes with my line managers.
	    I also developed the ability to negotiate deadlines and being able to say no, if I could not cope with the workload given to me.
	    Being honest with myself and other members of my team I worked with has led to clearer communication and positive mental health.
